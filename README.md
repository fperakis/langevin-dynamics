# Langevin Dynamics 

A modular and extensible Python package for simulating and analyzing overdamped and underdamped Langevin dynamics with stochastic switching between different frictional states. Includes tools for computing mean-squared displacement (MSD), non-Gaussian parameter (NGP), intermediate scattering functions (ISF), overlap functions, and four-point dynamical susceptibility (χ₄).

## Features

- Semi-implicit and explicit Langevin integrators  
- Two-state switching between liquid-like and glass like friction coefficients 
- Analysis tools: MSD, NGP, ISF, τₐ (alpha-relaxation), χ₄  
- Visualization of dynamic heterogeneity and local diffusion  
- Stretched exponential fitting for relaxation dynamics  
- Modular code structure with examples

## Getting started

Run a basic Langevin simulation:

```
from langevin.simulation import run_langevin_simulation

positions, velocities, gamma_record = run_langevin_simulation(
    T=1.0,           # temperature
    tau=1.0,         # residence time in each state
    n_steps=100000,  # number of time steps
    n_particles=100, # number of independent particles (no crossterm)
    dt=0.01,         # time step
    gamma_l=1.0,     # friction coeff. of liquid-like state 
    gamma_g=100.0    # friction coeff. of glass-like state 
)
```

Compute and plot the MSD

```
from langevin.analysis import compute_msd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

time, msd = compute_msd(positions, dt=0.01)

plt.loglog(time, msd)
plt.xlabel("Time")
plt.ylabel("MSD")
plt.show()
```

## Example Analyses

- Non-Gaussian Parameter (NGP): Quantifies deviations from Gaussian displacement statistics.
- Intermediate Scattering Function (ISF): Direction-averaged ISF for extracting τα and cage dynamics.
- Overlap Function & χ₄ Susceptibility: Tools for identifying dynamical heterogeneity and cooperative motion.
